			use = <"Use to record the results of a qualitative and semi-quantitative test array performed on a sample of urine, using reagent test strips. On exposure to urine, chemical reagent pads on the test strip change colour and the test result is read by visual comparison to a color chart at specified times after exposure.

Different commercial products carry a variety of test /reagent pads. Not all reagents need to be recorded at any one time, only those relevant to the test strip being used. The test strip used can be recorded utilising the 'Device' archetype within the 'Test Strip Used' slot.

This archetype is heavily influenced by the commonly available Multistix test strips but is intended to be generically applicable, as much as is possible. If requirements for other parameters become apparent to meet the requirements for other test strips then product-specific urinalysis archetypes may need to be developed.">
