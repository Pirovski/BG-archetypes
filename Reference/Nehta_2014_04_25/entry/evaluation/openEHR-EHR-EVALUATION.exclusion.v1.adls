This detailed clinical model (DCM) has specifically been designed to avoid the need to use flags or terminology to express negation about any item within the health record. 

This DCM has been deliberately kept simple and open in order to capture simple statements about anything that may be usefully recorded as absent or excluded within the health record. Specialisations of this DCM will capture specific and more detailed information about common exclusions, such as problems or diagnoses. 

Exclusion statements can only be considered to be current and accurate at the time of recording.">
