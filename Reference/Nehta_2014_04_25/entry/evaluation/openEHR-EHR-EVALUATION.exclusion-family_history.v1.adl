For example: to record that the subject does not have any significant family history; or that the subject has no family members with heart disease.

This detailed clinical model (DCM) has specifically been designed to avoid the need to use flags or terminology to express negation about any family history within the health record. 

Exclusion statements can only be considered to be current and accurate at the time of recording. For example: recording an exclusion is only relevant at the time of recording and may be effectively obsolete immediately after the record is made if new information is discovered.">
