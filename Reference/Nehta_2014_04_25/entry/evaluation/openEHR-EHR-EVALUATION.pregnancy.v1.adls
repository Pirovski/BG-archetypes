			use = <"Use to record an overview or summary record of an identified pregnancy including the antenatal period, labor, birth and the immediate postnatal period. 

This information in this archetype should ideally be only entered once, however there are some situations where it is useful to duplicate data elements. For example, within the context of a pregnancy summary it is helpful to include Apgar Score totals, however the entire detail of the Apgar Score is captured using a purpose built Apgar archetype. In this situation applications can ensure that there is not duplicate data entry required on behalf of the user but that these data elements within the summary are directly derived from the actual Apgar Score data.

During an active pregnancy, this archetype supports the evolution of a persistent pregnancy-related health summary record, with information gradually accumulated or updated, throughout the duration of the pregnancy, labor, birth and the immediate postnatal period. As the data is committed to the persistent health record, the date of the update is also recorded in the 'Last Updated' data element in Protocol, to ensure that if this pregnancy summary is taken out of context of the health record for other purposes, such as data exchange, the date of latest update is kept with the clinical data.

After birth, this summary record can be used as the basis for sharing key information with other healthcare providers about the pregnancy, labor, birth and immediate postnatal period. 

Each completed pregnancy summary saved to the health record can be re-used to populate the Past Pregnancy History details in subsequent pregnancy records.

In situations where completed pregnancy summaries are not available for each previous pregnancy, this archetype can also be used to record a relevant subset of information that can be used to populate the Past Pregnancy History details with new or active pregnancy records.">
