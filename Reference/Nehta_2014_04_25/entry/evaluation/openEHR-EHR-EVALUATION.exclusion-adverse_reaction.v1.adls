For example: to record that the subject has not ever had any significant adverse reactions; or that the subject has never had a reaction to penicillin.

This detailed clinical model (DCM) has specifically been designed to avoid the need to use flags or terminology to express negation about any adverse reactions within the health record. 

Exclusion statements can only be considered to be current and accurate at the time of recording. For example: recording an exclusion of a reaction to penicillin during a consultation is only relevant at the time of recording and may be effectively obsolete immediately after first administration of penicillin if there is an adverse reaction.">
