Use to record the interpretation all tympanogram measurements taken with a high frequency probe tone (probetone higher than 226 Hz) or a multifrequency probe tone, to infer middle ear function for each ear, plus an overall interpretation (or tympanometric diagnosis). 

All of the data elements are recorded using a single method or protocol. If, during the test, any of the protocol parameters need to be modified, then the subsequent part of the test will need to be recorded within a separate instance of the test data, using the updated protocol parameters.">
