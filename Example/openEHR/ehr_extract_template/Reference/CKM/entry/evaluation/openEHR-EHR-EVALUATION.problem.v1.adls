The archetype contains multiple dates, so can record present and/or past problems. 
A problem can be determined by either the individual themselves or a healthcare provider. 
Some examples: 
- A range of symptoms that are under investigation but pre-diagnosis
- Desire to lose weight, without formal diagnosis of Obesity
- Desire to quit smoking by individual
- Relationship problem with family member.">
