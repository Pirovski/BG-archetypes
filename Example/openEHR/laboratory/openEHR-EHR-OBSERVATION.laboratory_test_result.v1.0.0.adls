			use = <"Use to record any pathology laboratory test result, including the result of a test on a specimen taken as part of a composite procedure or operation.

Multi-analyte panels can be represented using templates or specialised archetypes.
 
More complex tests such as histopathology or microbiology should be represented using specialised archetypes where additional report content is required.

Laboratory Test Report has a high degree of alignment to an HL7 FHIR Diagnostic Report resource.

Will normally be reported back to the requesting clinician as one component within the context of an overall COMPOSITION-based report.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used for reporting on non-pathology test results e.g. diagnostic imaging, ECG or respiratory function tests.

Not to be used to represent an entire cumulative report. This laboratory test result archetype represents only one of the result sets that is usually viewed as a vertical in a cumulative test report. A cumulative report is a view that is constructed from the results represented by multiple OBSERVATION archetypes.

Not to be used to record an Autopsy report, although tests on some specimens that are taken at autopsy may be represented using this archetype.

This archetype is suitable for representation of general pathology test results, but not intended to cover full synoptic reports. For these, additional specialising archetypes are required to represent the data.

This archetype has been designed to support clinical pathology and may not be appropriate for other kinds of pathology use.">
