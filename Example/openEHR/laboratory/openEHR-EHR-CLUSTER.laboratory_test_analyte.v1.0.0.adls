			use = <"To record individual, single value laboratory test analyte results  as are common to clinical pathology testing such as biochemistry, haematology and immunology. Normally used in conjunction with a parent Laboratory test result (Observation) archetype andd in many circumstances will be carried within a Laboratory Test Result Panel Cluster archetype, along with other analytes which are normally tested and/or reported as part of a battery or test panel.

The name attribute of the analyte result element is normally replaced in a specialisation, template or at run-time to carry the name of the specific analyte e.g. 'Haemoglobin', often coded with a reference terminology such as LOINC, SNOMED CT or NPU.

This archetype may be used within the setting of more complex laboratory/pathology reporting such as Histopathlogy/ Anatomical synoptic reports where quantitative results such as cytometric flow studies or genetic testing are often reported alongside conventional macrscopic and microscopic reporting.
